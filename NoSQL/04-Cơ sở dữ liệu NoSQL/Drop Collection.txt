# Step 1: Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')

# Step 2: Choose the database you want to delete collections from
db = client['tiktokABC']  # Replace 'tiktokABC' with your database name

# Step 3: Get a list of all collections in the database
collections = db.list_collection_names()

# Step 4: Drop each collection
for collection_name in collections:
    db.drop_collection(collection_name)
    print(f"Collection {collection_name} dropped.")
